1. I will start today to record every day of my life, my mood, my behavior or whatever I think is worth recording.
2. I use nixOS as my main OS. but util now I haven't understood how ite works and it's giving me a headache.
3. I'm back to using obsidian as my note taking software. I have to say, the software built into nixOS is really comprehensive. I didn't even need to download it manually, after updating the config file and rebuilding it, it was there, great!
